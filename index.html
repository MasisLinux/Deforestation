            <h1>Deforestation</h1>
                <p class="para1">
                    According to the United Nations 
                    Framework Convention on Climate 
                    Change (UNFCCC) secretariat, the
                        overwhelming direct cause of 
                        deforestation is agriculture. 
                        Subsistence farming is responsible 
                        for 48% of deforestation; commercial 
                        agriculture is responsible for 32%; 
                        logging is responsible for 14%, and 
                        fuel wood removals make up 5%.
                    </p>
                <p class="para2">
                    Experts do not agree on whether 
                    industrial logging is an important
                    contributor to global deforestation.
                    Some argue that poor people are more 
                    likely to clear forest because they 
                    have no alternatives, others that the 
                    poor lack the ability to pay for the
                    materials and labour needed to clear 
                    forest. One study found that population 
                    increases due to high fertility rates 
                    were a primary driver of tropical 
                    deforestation in only 8% of cases.
